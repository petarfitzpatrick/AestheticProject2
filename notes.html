    <h1>Automa-tune</h1>
    <article>
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Why I Made This</h2>
    <p>For this project my idea was to create a cellular automata-like structure that utilized sound and interactions to allow users to create interesting aesthetics. I chose the colors used in the canvas because they were all very colorful flat colors that worked well together. I chose the red for the active cells because I felt that it really caught my eye as an "activated cell."</p>
    <p>The color choice of the html elements was meant to be dark and contrasting to really bring the canvas to the users attention. The font chosen was also meant to be a solid sans-serif since it matched the solid and flat design of the automata.</p>
    <p>Finally, the automata's ruleset of having each activated cell give off little pulses was meant to show users that the cells were interacting with eachother. Because of this little pulse effects, a lot of interesting visuals can come into play. I also gave the user a little bit of control over sound because I felt that modifying a few of those attributes could really change the feel of an entire experience with Automa-tune.</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size:30px;">Project 2:</h2>
    <p>For my second project I chose to create a brand new iteration of "automa-tune" since I had fun with the original version and had some neat ideas. My main purpose behind this next iteration was to give the user more dynamic control so that they aren't constantly making projects using sine waves.</p>
    <p>I first decided to give user control over the form different types of waveforms, which would give each experience a brand new sound. I did this in a way so that when the waveform is changed, the automata is kept the same, so users can play around with how their project would sound in different waveforms. Then I added another option to the sliders, which simply speeds up the animation of the canvas window. This is pretty fun when wanting to create projects with more or less tempo.</p>
    <p>The last thing that I added and my personal favorite is the new "Waveform mode." I had not originally planned to create this, however while I was adding the new checkboxes for the waveforms I became curious as to what they sounded like together. After looking at some examples on the gibber website I saw that combining different waveforms made sound productions that were at least ten times more interesting. Hearing different waveforms act upon eachother has helped me create some really unique sounds.</p>
